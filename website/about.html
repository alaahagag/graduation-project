          <p>Epilepsy is usually only diagnosed after a person has had more than one seizure. Not all seizures are due to epilepsy. Other conditions that can look like epilepsy include fainting, or very low blood sugar in some people being treated for diabetes.

          Anyone can develop epilepsy, at any time of life. It happens in people of all ages, races and social classes. Epilepsy is most commonly diagnosed in children and in people over 65. There are  more than 81,600 persons with epilepsy in Egypt (prevalence of 6.8 per 1,000 people).</p>
          
          <h5 id="item-1-1">Causes of epilepsy</h5>
          <p>Different epilepsies are due to many different underlying causes. The causes can be complex, and sometimes hard to identify. A person might start having seizures because they have one or more of the following.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             A genetic tendency, passed down from one or both parents (inherited).
            </li>
            <li>
              A genetic tendency that is not inherited, but is a new change in the person's genes.
            </li>
            <li>
              A structural (sometimes called 'symptomatic') change in the brain, such as the brain not developing properly, or damage caused by a brain injury, infections like meningitis, a stroke or a tumour. A brain scan, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), may show this.

          <h4 id="item-2">Epileptic seizures</h4>
          <p>There are many different types of epileptic seizure. Any of us could potentially have a single epileptic seizure at some point in our lives. This is not the same as having epilepsy, which is a tendency to have seizures that start in the brain.</p>
          
          <h5 id="item-2-1">Types of seizure</h5>
          <p>Seizures are divided into groups depending on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>where they start in the brain (onset)</li>
            <li>whether or not a person's awareness is affected</li>
            <li>whether or not seizures involve other symptoms, such as movement</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Depending on where they start, seizures are described as being focal onset, generalised onset or unknown onset.</p>

          <h5 id="item-2-2">Seizure triggers</h5>
          <p>Triggers are situations that can bring on a seizure in some people with epilepsy. Some people's seizures are brought on by certain situations. Triggers can differ from person to person, but common triggers include tiredness and lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, and not taking medication. For some people, if they know what triggers their seizures, they may be able to avoid these triggers and so lessen the chances of having a seizure.</p>
